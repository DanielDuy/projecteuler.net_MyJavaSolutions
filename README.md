# projecteuler.net_MyJavaSolutions
My solutions of the problems on the website "projecteuler.net" written in Java code. Feel free to leave any comments on how I can improve my code to make it more efficient or do less steps :)
I typically make code that is simple enough for me to understand, when I go back and read it again, even if I add an unnecessery variable for example.
